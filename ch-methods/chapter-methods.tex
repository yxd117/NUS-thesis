\chapter{Methodology\label{ch:Methodology}}
In this thesis, we basically adopt an optimization based attacks which is to minimize a loss function we defined by generating a series of faces with some specific attributes.

The overall workflow of the attacks is shown above ~\ref{fig:ch-methods:iterative_attack}. We call this an iterative adversarial face attack. The steps are as follows.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Given an input image, we use a face synthesizer to generate a synthesized face.
    \item  Then we fit the face into a FRS which a gallery of $N$ people is already registered.
    \item After that we get the ID of the people as well as the confidence score.
    \item Finally we compared the score with a pre-defined threshold to determine whether the attack is successful or not.
    \item If not, we will go back to the face synthesizer to generate a new face and continue steps. 
\end{itemize}
  
Details of the algorithms as well different types of attacks will be discussed later in this section.
