I would like to thank the CS department for offering such an opportunity for me to explore a new research topic. I would like to thank my parents, without whom my life would not be possible. I would also like to thank my advisor because he is very supportive. Although the project is quite complex, he do provides me with guidance and resources. Finally, I really enjoy the life studying in NUS and I sincerely appreciate the life that NUS provides with us.
